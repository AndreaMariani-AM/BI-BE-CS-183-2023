               (scRNA-seq) 1 often encounter a choice between highthroughput
               droplet-based methods and high-sensitivity plate-based methods.
               There is a widespread belief that scRNA-seq will often fail to
               generate measurements for some genes from some cells owing to
               technical molecular inefficiencies. It is believed that this
               causes data to have an overabundance of zero values compared to
               what is expected from random sampling and that this effect is
               particularly pronounced in â€¦",
