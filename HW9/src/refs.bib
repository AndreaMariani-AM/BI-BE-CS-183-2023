  abstract  = "In a living cell, gene expression--the transcription of DNA to
               messenger RNA followed by translation to protein--occurs
               stochastically, as a consequence of the low copy number of DNA
               and mRNA molecules involved. These stochastic events of protein
               production are difficult to observe directly with measurements
               on large ensembles of cells owing to lack of synchronization
               among cells. Measurements so far on single cells lack the
               sensitivity to resolve individual events of protein production.
               Here we demonstrate a microfluidic-based assay that allows
               real-time observation of the expression of beta-galactosidase in
               living Escherichia coli cells with single molecule sensitivity.
               We observe that protein production occurs in bursts, with the
               number of molecules per burst following an exponential
               distribution. We show that the two key parameters of protein
               expression--the burst size and frequency--can be either
               determined directly from real-time monitoring of protein
               production or extracted from a measurement of the steady-state
               copy number distribution in a population of cells. Application
               of this assay to probe gene expression in individual budding
               yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells demonstrates its
               generality. Many important proteins are expressed at low levels,
               and are thus inaccessible by current genomic and proteomic
               techniques. This microfluidic single cell assay opens up
               possibilities for system-wide characterization of the expression
               of these low copy number proteins.",
