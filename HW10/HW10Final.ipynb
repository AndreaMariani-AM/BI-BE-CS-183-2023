With the metadata for this dataset, the cell types and ages of the mice used, you will then compare the efficacy of logistic regression vs neural network based techniques for classifying the age of the mouse a cell came from.\n"

We will define our model in a class that extends nn.Module. nn.Module subclasses must do a minimum of one thing: implement the forward method which takes a batch of data and performs the forward-pass. PyTorch's autograd system computes the gradients of the forward pass for us. In the code below we'll also make use of the constructor of our model to instantiate the hidden and output layers.The model is a simple neural network with one hidden layer. A rectifier linear unit (ReLU) activation function is used for the neurons in the hidden layer. The nn.Module class defines a instance variable called training that is set to True when the model is being trained and False when it is being evaluated after being trained. Since we would like our output to represent probabilities of the cell being from either of the two age groups (outputs are between 0 and 1, and sum up to 1), we can use the [softmax activation function](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.softmax.html#torch.nn.functional.softmax) on our output layer to turn the outputs into probability-like values. **Complete the code below by implementing the softmax function on the output when the model is not being trained.** We do this because we will use PyTorch's implementation of Cross Entropy Loss (nn.CrossEntropyLoss) during training which implicitly adds a softmax before a logarithmic loss."
